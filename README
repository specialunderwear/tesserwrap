Tesserwrap - Basic Tesseract API Wrapper for Python

Tesserwrap is a project that allows simple bindings to Tesseract's API rather than executing the application manually each time.

By default Tesserwrap looks for tesseract in /usr/local/, when installing with
tessract in a different location either set the LIBTESSERACT environment variable
to the location of your tesseract PREFIX or install with --with-libtesseract=PREFIX.
